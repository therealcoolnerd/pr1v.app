# Fix for WalletContext.jsx

## Issue Found
I identified a syntax error in the WalletContext.jsx file that would cause build failures and prevent tests from passing.

### Problem
There was a typo in the function declaration at the beginning of the file:

```javascript
// Incorrect code
tunction isValidAddress(address) {
function isValidAddress(address) {
    return /^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$/.test(address);
}
```

The code had both a misspelled `tunction` declaration and a duplicate correct `function` declaration on the next line, which would cause a syntax error.

### Fix
I removed the incorrect `tunction` declaration and kept only the correct `function` declaration:

```javascript
// Fixed code
function isValidAddress(address) {
    return /^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$/.test(address);
}
```

This fix will resolve the syntax error and allow the code to compile and pass tests successfully, which should make the build status "lit green and passing" as requested.
