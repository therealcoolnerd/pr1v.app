# Pr1v.app Project Outline

## Project Overview

Pr1v.app is a decentralized privacy toolkit built to empower users with full control over their digital assets while maintaining anonymity and security. Designed to address gaps in on-chain privacy, Pr1v.app provides tools such as wallet scrubbing, stealth transfers, and gift-based crypto sharing.

Pr1v.app is launching as a minimal, secure, and censorship-resistant interface for interacting with privacy-enhancing smart contracts across EVM-compatible chains.

## Target Platforms

- Ethereum Mainnet
- Layer 2 Networks:
  - Base
  - Polygon zkEVM
  - Arbitrum

## Core Features

### 1. Wallet Scrubber

**Purpose:** Clean wallets from toxic or blacklisted tokens (e.g., OFAC-sanctioned, dust attack remnants).

**Technical Specifications:**
- Detection system for flagged or potentially malicious tokens
- Local heuristics combined with on-chain verification
- No external token list dependencies to maintain censorship resistance
- Burn functionality to send tokens to 0x000...dead address
- Optional wallet migration path generator for complete privacy reset

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Smart contract (WalletScrubber.sol) to handle token filtering and burning
- Frontend interface for wallet analysis and visualization of potentially problematic tokens
- Integration with blockchain explorers for token verification
- Secure, client-side processing to ensure no data leaves user's device

### 2. Private Send (ZK Transfers)

**Purpose:** Provide stealth-based private transfers for ETH and ERC20 tokens.

**Technical Specifications:**
- Zero-knowledge proof system for transaction privacy
- zkSNARK-based implementation using Circom and SnarkJS
- No metadata logging to ensure complete privacy
- Optional IPFS storage for encrypted public proof (user choice)
- Support for time-locked or one-time-use wallet claims

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Smart contract (ZkSend.sol) to handle proof verification and token transfers
- Client-side proof generation to ensure private keys never leave user device
- Integration with stealth address protocols
- Verifier contract to validate zero-knowledge proofs on-chain

### 3. Gift Link Generator

**Purpose:** Create links for anonymous crypto transfers.

**Technical Specifications:**
- Temporary wallet generation with secure private key handling
- Encrypted storage of private keys linked to unique URLs
- Self-destruct functionality for one-time use
- Support for various token types (ETH, ERC20, ERC721)

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Smart contract (GiftLinkFactory.sol) to create one-time wallet contracts
- Secure, client-side encryption of private keys
- Integration with frontend for easy link generation and sharing
- Claim verification system to prevent unauthorized access

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts

1. **WalletScrubber.sol**
   - Functions for token detection and classification
   - Burn logic for unwanted tokens
   - Asset filtering and alert mechanisms

2. **ZkSend.sol**
   - Accepts inputs for ZK proof
   - Handles token transfers based on verified proofs
   - Emits encrypted outputs to stealth wallets

3. **GiftLinkFactory.sol**
   - Creates one-time wallet contracts
   - Handles ephemeral keypair generation
   - Manages claim verification

4. **Verifier.sol**
   - On-chain verifier for ZK proof validation
   - Generated from SnarkJS or similar ZK framework
   - Optimized for gas efficiency

### Frontend Architecture

1. **Technology Stack**
   - Next.js for frontend framework
   - TailwindCSS for styling
   - Ethers.js/Web3.js for blockchain interaction
   - Wagmi + RainbowKit for wallet connections

2. **Key Components**
   - Wallet connection interface (supporting multiple providers)
   - Feature-specific modules for each core function
   - Responsive design for both desktop and mobile
   - Progressive web app capabilities

3. **Security Features**
   - Client-side encryption
   - No server-side storage of sensitive data
   - Optional IPFS integration for decentralized storage
   - Comprehensive input validation

## Privacy and Security Considerations

1. **Zero-Knowledge Implementation**
   - Use of proven ZK libraries and frameworks
   - Circuit design with minimal information disclosure
   - Thorough testing of proof generation and verification

2. **Smart Contract Security**
   - Comprehensive testing suite
   - Security audit before deployment
   - Bug bounty program
   - Immutable contracts post-deployment

3. **Frontend Security**
   - No backend or logging services
   - Client-side processing of sensitive operations
   - Open-source code for transparency
   - IPFS-hosted frontend option for censorship resistance

4. **Exploit Mitigation Strategies**

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Dust Attack | Token detection heuristic + burn tools |
| Replay Attack | One-time proof + nonce lock |
| Link Hijack | Self-destructing claim links |
| Wallet Drain | Manual opt-in asset migration only |
| Contract Upgrade Attack | All contracts immutable post-deployment |

## Monetization Strategy

- Fee per operation (similar to Tornado Cash pricing)
- Affordable pricing in the $10-$25 range
- Transparent fee structure
- No token or DAO governance
