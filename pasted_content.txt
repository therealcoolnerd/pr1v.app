PR1V DAO Whitepaper

Overview

PR1V DAO is a decentralized privacy toolkit built to empower users with full control over their digital assets while maintaining anonymity and security. Designed to address gaps in on-chain privacy, PR1V DAO provides tools such as wallet scrubbing, stealth transfers, and gift-based crypto sharing.

PR1V DAO is launching as a minimal, secure, and censorship-resistant interface for interacting with privacy-enhancing smart contracts across EVM-compatible chains.

Phase One Scope

Initial Focus: Ethereum Mainnet + Layer 2s (Base, Polygon zkEVM, Arbitrum)

Features launching in Phase One:

Wallet Scrubber

Private Send (zkSNARK-based)

Gift Link Generator

Connect Wallet Interface (Mobile + Desktop)

Roadmap (Post-Phase One):

Support for Solana, Bitcoin (via Lightning, Taproot, PSBT)

Layer 2 optimization

Token-gated access

DAO governance modules

Key Features & Modules

1. Wallet Scrubber

Purpose: Clean wallets from toxic or blacklisted tokens (e.g. OFAC-sanctioned, dust attack remnants).

Functionality:

Detect flagged or dust attack tokens

Allow user to burn/send to 0x000…dead

Option to generate new wallet and initiate asset migration plan

Security:

No external token list dependencies

Local heuristics + on-chain verification

No custody of assets

2. Private Send (ZK Transfers)

Purpose: Provide stealth-based private transfers for ETH and ERC20 tokens.

Functionality:

zkSNARK-based proof generation using Circom + SnarkJS

Transfer funds to burner wallets or stealth addresses

Optional time-locked / one-time-use wallet claim

Security:

No metadata logging

IPFS for encrypted public proof storage (optional)

User-side key generation and proof signing

3. Create Gift Link

Purpose: Create links for anonymous crypto transfers.

Functionality:

Generate new wallet with temporary private key

Store private key in encrypted format linked to URL

Self-destruct link logic available

Use Cases:

Anonymous donations

Crypto gifting

Whistleblower payouts

Smart Contract Architecture

Contracts Required:

WalletScrubber.sol

Burn logic for dust tokens

Asset filtering and alert functions

ZkSend.sol

Accepts inputs for ZK proof

Emits encrypted outputs to stealth wallets

Uses SnarkJS verifier or external ZK Verifier contract

GiftLinkFactory.sol

Creates one-time wallet contracts

Handles ephemeral keypair generation

Verifier.sol (ZK SNARK Verifier)

On-chain verifier for proof validation

Imported from SnarkJS-generated code

Development & Security Summary

Development Summary

Built in-house using Vite/Next.js + TailwindCSS

React frontend integrated with Wagmi + RainbowKit (EVM support)

Circom + SnarkJS for ZK proof compilation

IPFS (Web3.Storage or Fleek) for metadata + proof uploads

Minimal external dependencies to preserve censorship-resistance

Security Considerations

ZK proof integrity ensured with strict circuit design

Contracts audited internally and through bug bounty program

Frontend serves no backend or logs

Option to verify contracts publicly on Etherscan

Exploit Mitigation

Threat

Mitigation

Dust Attack

Token detection heuristic + burn tools

Replay Attack

One-time proof + nonce lock

Link Hijack

Self-destructing claim links

Wallet Drain

Manual opt-in asset migration only

Contract Upgrade Attack

All contracts immutable post-deployment

Trust & Censorship Resistance

Fully open-source on GitHub

IPFS-hosted frontend option (no centralized hosting)

No tracking, no analytics

Anonymous usage by design

Monetization Strategy

Fee per proof generation (ZK compute cost)

Token-gated access to premium modules

Optional DAO-governed subscription model

Conclusion

PR1V DAO is a tactical response to the increasing surveillance and traceability in Web3. By offering wallet privacy tools, decentralized payment rails, and gift-based crypto sending, it empowers users to take control of their on-chain identity and safety.

This protocol is the spiritual successor to the ideals of Tornado Cash—reimagined for today, secured for tomorrow, and built to thrive across chains.

Let privacy be the protocol.
